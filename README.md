Here’s the description of the To-Do List App in clear points:

The app is a front-end only To-Do list built using HTML, internal CSS, and JavaScript.

Users can add new tasks through an input box and an Add button.

Each task is shown as a list item with the task text and two action buttons.

The Complete button (✓) toggles the task state by striking through the text.

The Remove button (✕) deletes the task from the list.

Tasks update instantly in the browser using DOM manipulation (no page reload).

Internal CSS styles define layout, colors, and simple UI design.

Internal JavaScript handles event listeners and task operations (add, complete, delete).
